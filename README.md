# Uncanny / Unheimlich â€“ A Media Design Project

## About the Project
This project was created as part of our media design studies in Germany. My friend and I worked together to gain our first experiences with **SCSS** while building a small website based on the theme **"Uncanny"** ("Unheimlich" in German).

The website contains various **HTML elements**, styled with **SCSS**, to explore the possibilities of modern web design. It was a learning experience focused on structuring styles efficiently and creating a coherent, eerie aesthetic.

## Features
- **SCSS-based Styling**: Our first deep dive into using SCSS for modular and structured CSS.
- **Thematic Design**: A dark and mysterious aesthetic that matches the given theme.
- **HTML Elements**: A variety of common HTML elements implemented and styled.
- **Privacy-Conscious Images**: All images used are sourced from **[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)** to ensure GDPR compliance.
- **Content in German**: Since this project was created for a university course in Germany, all textual content on the website is in **German**.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **SCSS (SASS Preprocessor)**
- **JavaScript (basic interactions)**

## Learnings & Reflections
This project allowed us to:
- Understand the **basics of SCSS** and how to structure stylesheets efficiently.
- Experiment with **typography, colors, and layouts** to create a specific mood.
- Gain practical experience in **responsive web design**.
